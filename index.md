<h4><strong><em>It’s always hard being the guinea pig.</em></strong><h4>

<p> My first week at the Awesome Inc. Bootcamp was everything that I dreaded. I already had quite a few trepidations about having this be an online setting versus the in person setting that I specifically picked this program for having. My previous experiences with remote learning during the pandemic still gives me anxiety and stress induced trauma reactions when I think of them. I also have my own trigger issues with school, work and life that I knew were probably going to be tested. Not to mention my intense anxiety that always flares up at the most inopportune times.  

This week we dealt with bugs and broken tutorials, conflicting instructions, miscommunication with help questions, tons of readings in what for me is one of the worst formats to digest, and many more frustrations from learning and trying new things. I deeply felt the isolation of being remote, missing time with my children, and anxieties that caused blocks to my progress. I do wish we were able to be in person, and I wish things had gone more smoothly this week. I actually enjoy problem solving and fixing things. I just didn’t come prepared to do it on day one.</p>

<p>I am very much looking forward to being able to continue to learn more about all of the different languages, tools, programs etc. that are to come.  I’m looking forward to reaching a place where we are all more comfortable with each other and the format of the bootcamp. Everyone seems great and as time goes on hopefully we will be able to develop more of a community among ourselves even if we are not in the same room. So in the spirit of getting to know each other I present...</p>

<h4><strong><em>Strange and random things about me…</em></strong></h4>
<br />
<p>I have recently discovered that I have aphantasia which means I do not see images in my head. I don’t hear voices in my head. I don’t taste or smell things from memory.  I’m sure there are other things I don’t do that other people do but honestly finding out that people have all this going on in their heads when I don’t was enough of a world shaking revelation that I’m still processing.  I also do not remember any of my dreams. Maybe they are related. Who knows.</p>
